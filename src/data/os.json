    "options": ["Processes share memory, threads do not", "Threads are independent units of execution, processes are not", "Threads share memory space, processes do not", "Processes execute faster than threads"],
    "correct": 2,
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "topic": "Operating Systems - Process vs Thread",
    "explanation": "Threads within a process share memory space (heap and data), while processes are completely isolated. This makes threads lighter and more efficient for parallel tasks within a single application."
  },

    "id": "os2",
    "question": "Which of the following components is unique to each thread in a process?",
    "options": ["Heap", "Code Segment", "Data Segment", "Stack"],
    "correct": 3,
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "topic": "Operating Systems - Thread Structure",
    "explanation": "Each thread has its own stack and registers, which are used for function calls and local variables. The heap and code are shared among all threads in the same process."
  },

    "id": "os3",
    "question": "In a multi-threaded process, which part of memory is shared among all threads?",
    "options": ["Stack", "Registers", "Heap", "Program Counter"],
    "correct": 2,
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "topic": "Operating Systems - Memory Sharing",
    "explanation": "The heap is shared across all threads in a process, allowing them to access and modify common data. In contrast, each thread has its own stack and program counter."
  },
  {
    "id": "os4",
    "question": "Which of the following is a valid advantage of using threads over processes?",
    "options": ["Threads are more secure", "Threads use more resources", "Threads have faster context switching", "Threads cannot communicate with each other"],
    "correct": 2,
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "topic": "Operating Systems - Thread Advantages",
    "explanation": "Threads are lightweight and require fewer resources than processes. Context switching between threads is faster because they share memory and execution environment."

  {
    "id": "os5",
    "question": "If one thread crashes in a process, what is the possible effect?",
    "options": ["Only that thread terminates", "All threads in the process may be affected", "It will restart automatically", "It has no effect on other threads"],
    "correct": 1,
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "topic": "Operating Systems - Thread Safety",
    "explanation": "Since threads share the same memory space, an error in one thread (e.g., accessing invalid memory) can corrupt shared data and potentially crash the entire process."
